-- Chapter 4
-- Objective: Let X and Y be two finite disjoint sets of elements over some ordered type
-- and of combined size greater than k . Consider the problem of computing
-- the k th smallest element of X âˆª Y . By definition, the k th smallest ele-
-- ment of a set is one for which there are exactly k elements smaller than it,
-- so the zeroth smallest is the smallest. How long does such a computation
-- take?
