-- Chapter 4
-- Objective: Let X and Y be two finite disjoint sets of elements over some ordered type
-- and of combined size greater than k . Consider the problem of computing
-- the k th smallest element of X âˆª Y . By definition, the k th smallest ele-
-- ment of a set is one for which there are exactly k elements smaller than it,
-- so the zeroth smallest is the smallest. How long does such a computation
-- take?

-- Divide and conquer implementation
-- This implementation feels like an overkill (I don't understand the
-- proof either) which can be done the way @smallest@ function has
-- been defined above.
-- See https://github.com/derekmcloughlin/pearls/tree/master/chap04
